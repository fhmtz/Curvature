#Curvature is a designer allows you draw curves. It generates Canvas 2d APIs relevant code in different forms/styles.

Today release contains following new features:
➛ Curves Alignment (align any point, to any coordinate of the screen)
➛ You can drag whole curve (as it is!)
➛ You can drag whole drawing (all curves – without any disturbance!)
➛ You can copy whole drawing exactly!
➛ You can get shortened code too!

Today version also allows you hide/show the coding area; so you can have a full drawing surface, now!
